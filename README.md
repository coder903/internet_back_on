Have you ever been busy working on a project when your internet service gets interrupted? Waiting on your ISP to fix it can be frustrating.
Instead of checking your internet every few minutes to see if its back on, why not just use this python script that starts making noise when it comes back on. It only works in Linux for now. It needs a script to make noise in Windows. I would also add a line to detect which OS the program was on and use the sound file for that OS. Feel free to send a PR if you feel like fixing that.
